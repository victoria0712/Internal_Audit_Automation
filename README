## Description

PO-HC Manager was built to automate the process of tracking more than 3k purchase orders in 30 cost centers for risk control for APJC. It results in a 300% increase in process efficiency, with subsequent model adopted by EMEA and PRC.

One of the primary risks is related to unprocessed purchase orders due to staff turnover. When team members depart without closing their purchase orders, it can lead to operational bottlenecks and potential financial discrepancies. Additionally, newly onboarded team members who initiate purchase orders before completing internal training pose a risk to accuracy and compliance.

To counter these challenges, PO-HC Manager focuses on optimizing purchase order management and minimizing associated risks for Sales Audit Specialists in Sales & Marketing Business Unit Finance Team. By introducing an automated purchase order tracking system, Sales Audit Specialists proactively address the risk of unprocessed orders. This intelligent system ensures that purchase orders are diligently tracked and managed even during transitions, mitigating operational bottlenecks.
